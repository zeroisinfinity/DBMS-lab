Alright — let’s go **all in** on `GROUP BY`.
We’ll cover **concepts, rules, gotchas, optimizations, and code examples** for **MySQL**, **SQL Server (MSSQL)**, and **PostgreSQL**.

---

## 1. **What `GROUP BY` Does**

`GROUP BY` is used to **aggregate rows** into groups based on column values, typically combined with **aggregate functions** like `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`.

Example:

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) 
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

This counts employees in each department.

---

## 2. **Basic Rules**

* All **non-aggregated** columns in the `SELECT` must appear in the `GROUP BY`.
* Aggregate functions summarize multiple rows into one value per group.
* `GROUP BY` runs **after** `WHERE` but **before** `ORDER BY`.
* Filtering **after grouping** requires `HAVING` instead of `WHERE`.

---

## 3. **Execution Order (Simplified)**

1. `FROM` / `JOIN`
2. `WHERE` (filter before grouping)
3. `GROUP BY`
4. `HAVING` (filter after grouping)
5. `SELECT`
6. `ORDER BY`
7. `LIMIT` / `OFFSET`

---

## 4. **Basic Examples in All Three**

### MySQL

```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
WHERE status = 'Active'
GROUP BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;
```

### SQL Server (MSSQL)

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5
ORDER BY total_employees DESC;
```

### PostgreSQL

```sql
SELECT department, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM orders
GROUP BY department
HAVING SUM(sales) > 100000
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```

---

## 5. **Grouping by Multiple Columns**

You can group by more than one column:

```sql
SELECT department, role, COUNT(*) AS count_role
FROM employees
GROUP BY department, role
ORDER BY department, role;
```

Result: unique `(department, role)` combinations.

---

## 6. **Using Expressions in `GROUP BY`**

```sql
SELECT YEAR(order_date) AS order_year, COUNT(*) AS orders_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY YEAR(order_date);
```

PostgreSQL equivalent:

```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS order_year, COUNT(*)
FROM orders
GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date);
```

SQL Server equivalent:

```sql
SELECT YEAR(order_date) AS order_year, COUNT(*)
FROM orders
GROUP BY YEAR(order_date);
```

---

## 7. **`GROUP BY` with Joins**

```sql
SELECT c.country, COUNT(o.id) AS total_orders
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.country;
```

---

## 8. **Filtering with `HAVING`**

`WHERE` filters before grouping, `HAVING` filters after:

```sql
-- Count customers with more than 5 orders
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

---

## 9. **`GROUP BY ROLLUP` and `CUBE` (Advanced)**

These produce subtotals and grand totals.

### MySQL

```sql
SELECT department, role, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department, role WITH ROLLUP;
```

### SQL Server

```sql
SELECT department, role, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY ROLLUP(department, role);
```

### PostgreSQL

```sql
SELECT department, role, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY ROLLUP(department, role);
```

**`CUBE`** gives all combinations:

```sql
GROUP BY CUBE(department, role);
```

---

## 10. **`GROUPING SETS`**

Manually specify group combinations.

```sql
SELECT department, role, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (
    (department, role),
    (department),
    ()
);
```

**`()`** means grand total.

---

## 11. **`DISTINCT` vs `GROUP BY`**

* `DISTINCT` removes duplicates, no aggregates.
* `GROUP BY` aggregates and can calculate metrics.

Example:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT department FROM employees;
```

is similar to:

```sql
SELECT department FROM employees GROUP BY department;
```

but only the second allows `SUM`, `COUNT`, etc.

---

## 12. **Performance Tips**

* Ensure **indexes** exist on grouping columns for large datasets.
* Avoid grouping on unindexed expressions if possible.
* Use `ROLLUP`/`CUBE` cautiously on very large datasets—they multiply result sets.
* Pre-aggregate with subqueries or materialized views for performance.

I can also give you a **side-by-side MySQL vs MSSQL vs PostgreSQL cheatsheet** for `GROUP BY` syntax so you have it in one glance. That’ll make it even easier for cross-DB work.

Do you want me to prepare that next?
