#PARTITION BY: The Complete, Practical Guide (MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL)

PARTITION BY is part of the OVER(...) clause used by window functions to segment rows into groups so calculations reset within each group rather than across the whole result set. It works with ranking (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK), navigation (LAG/LEAD), and aggregates (SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, COUNT) in all major engines.[1][2][3][4]

## What PARTITION BY Does

- Divides the result into independent “partitions” based on one or more expressions/columns; window functions compute within each partition separately.[5][3][1]
- If omitted, the entire result set is treated as a single partition (global calculation).[6][2][5]
- Often paired with ORDER BY to define processing order inside each partition; ORDER BY inside OVER is independent from the query’s final ORDER BY.[2][3][1]

## Syntax Essentials

- Generic form:
  - window_function(...) OVER (PARTITION BY col1, col2 ORDER BY sort_col [frame])
  - Without PARTITION BY, the function operates over all rows as one partition.[5][1][2]
- MySQL note: permits expressions (e.g., PARTITION BY HOUR(ts)), which goes beyond strict standard SQL allowing columns only.[2]

## When to Use PARTITION BY

- Reset calculations per group: per-department ranks, per-customer running totals, per-category shares.[7][1][5]
- Keep row detail while adding group-level metrics, unlike GROUP BY which collapses rows.[1][7][5]
- Top-N per group by combining with RANK/ROW_NUMBER and filtering in an outer query.[7][5][2]

## Core Patterns (Paste-ready)

1) Per-department salary ranks (ties allowed vs compact)
- RANK vs DENSE_RANK
SELECT
  e.department_id,
  e.employee_name,
  e.salary,
  RANK()       OVER (PARTITION BY e.department_id ORDER BY e.salary DESC)       AS rnk,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY e.department_id ORDER BY e.salary DESC)       AS dense_rnk
FROM employees e
ORDER BY department_id, salary DESC;[5][1][2]

2) Running total per customer
SELECT
  o.customer_id,
  o.order_id,
  o.order_date,
  o.total_amount,
  SUM(o.total_amount) OVER (
    PARTITION BY o.customer_id
    ORDER BY o.order_date, o.order_id
    ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) AS running_total
FROM orders o
ORDER BY o.customer_id, o.order_date, o.order_id;[3][1][2]

3) Latest order per customer (deduplicate to 1 row each)
SELECT *
FROM (
  SELECT
    o.*,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      PARTITION BY o.customer_id
      ORDER BY o.order_date DESC, o.order_id DESC
    ) AS rn
  FROM orders o
) x
WHERE rn = 1
ORDER BY customer_id;[1][7][5]

4) Top 3 products by quantity within each category
SELECT *
FROM (
  SELECT
    p.category,
    p.product_name,
    SUM(o.quantity) AS qty,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY p.category ORDER BY SUM(o.quantity) DESC) AS rnk
  FROM products p
  JOIN orders o ON o.product_id = p.product_id
  GROUP BY p.category, p.product_name
) t
WHERE rnk <= 3
ORDER BY category, rnk, qty DESC, product_name;[2][7][5]

5) Share of category revenue per customer (percent-of-total within partition)
WITH cat_rev AS (
  SELECT
    o.customer_id,
    p.category,
    SUM(o.total_amount) AS rev
  FROM orders o
  JOIN products p ON p.product_id = o.product_id
  GROUP BY o.customer_id, p.category
)
SELECT
  category,
  customer_id,
  rev,
  ROUND(100.0 * rev / SUM(rev) OVER (PARTITION BY category), 2) AS pct_of_category
FROM cat_rev
ORDER BY category, rev DESC;[6][7][1]

6) LAG/LEAD with PARTITION BY (previous order per customer)
SELECT
  o.customer_id,
  o.order_id,
  o.order_date,
  o.total_amount,
  LAG(o.total_amount) OVER (
    PARTITION BY o.customer_id
    ORDER BY o.order_date, o.order_id
  ) AS prev_amount
FROM orders o
ORDER BY o.customer_id, o.order_date, o.order_id;[8][6][1]

7) FIRST_VALUE/LAST_VALUE across entire partition (explicit frame)
SELECT
  o.customer_id,
  o.order_id,
  o.order_date,
  o.total_amount,
  FIRST_VALUE(o.total_amount) OVER (
    PARTITION BY o.customer_id
    ORDER BY o.order_date, o.order_id
    ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
  ) AS first_amount,
  LAST_VALUE(o.total_amount) OVER (
    PARTITION BY o.customer_id
    ORDER BY o.order_date, o.order_id
    ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
  ) AS last_amount
FROM orders o
ORDER BY o.customer_id, o.order_date, o.order_id;[3][1][2]

8) Percentile-like scores: PERCENT_RANK and CUME_DIST within department
SELECT
  e.department_id,
  e.employee_name,
  e.salary,
  PERCENT_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY e.department_id ORDER BY e.salary) AS pct_rank,
  CUME_DIST()   OVER (PARTITION BY e.department_id ORDER BY e.salary) AS cume_dist
FROM employees e
ORDER BY e.department_id, e.salary;[9][4][1]

9) NTILE buckets (deciles of customer revenue)
SELECT
  o.customer_id,
  SUM(o.total_amount) AS revenue,
  NTILE(10) OVER (ORDER BY SUM(o.total_amount) DESC) AS revenue_decile
FROM orders o
GROUP BY o.customer_id
ORDER BY revenue DESC;[4][8][6]

10) Window name reuse (define once, use many)
- MySQL/PG/SQL Server support named windows via WINDOW clause; reuse PARTITION BY/ORDER BY definitions to simplify queries.
SELECT
  e.*,
  RANK()       OVER w AS r1,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER w AS r2
FROM employees e
WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY e.department_id ORDER BY e.salary DESC);[6][1][2]

## PARTITION BY vs GROUP BY

- GROUP BY collapses rows to one per group, returning aggregated rows only.[7][5]
- PARTITION BY keeps every row and adds aggregated/ranked values per partition alongside detail rows.[5][1][7]

## Engine Notes and Nuances

- MySQL 8+:
  - Supports PARTITION BY in window functions and allows expressions in PARTITION BY (e.g., PARTITION BY HOUR(ts)), an extension over standard SQL.[2]
  - No QUALIFY; filter window results via subqueries/CTEs.[2]
- SQL Server:
  - Full window support including ranking, distributions, percentiles; use outer WHERE on subqueries/CTEs to filter by rank.[10][4][7]
- PostgreSQL:
  - Very complete window feature set and authoritative docs; ORDER BY and frame behavior are clearly specified; supports ordered-set aggregates and FILTER for conditional aggregates.[4][3][1]

## Best Practices

- Add deterministic tiebreakers to ORDER BY (e.g., salary DESC, employee_id ASC) to avoid non-deterministic ranks/numbers.[3][1][2]
- For running totals or moving windows, specify ROWS/RANGE/GROUPS frames explicitly to avoid surprises from defaults.[1][3]
- Pre-aggregate (GROUP BY) before applying window functions to reduce repeated work and improve performance.[8][7]
- Index columns used in PARTITION BY and ORDER BY when feasible to aid sorting and partition scans.[10][7]

## Common Misconceptions

- “PARTITION BY filters rows.” It doesn’t filter; it groups rows for window computation while preserving all rows unless the outer query filters.[7][5]
- “ORDER BY in OVER must match final ORDER BY.” It’s independent; window ORDER BY defines computation order, not the output ordering.[3][1]
- “GROUP BY and PARTITION BY are interchangeable.” They serve different purposes: collapsing vs annotating with per-group metrics.[5][7]

## Quick Visual Definition

- Think of PARTITION BY like creating mini result sets per key (e.g., per department); the window function runs in each mini set separately, then results are stitched back together without losing individual rows.[6][1][5]
