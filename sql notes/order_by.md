Alright — let’s do a **deep dive** into the `ORDER BY` clause so you’ll know *literally everything* about it, from basics to advanced tricks, with examples for **PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server** where relevant.

---

## **1. What `ORDER BY` Does**

`ORDER BY` sorts the rows returned by a SQL query based on one or more columns or expressions.

**Basic Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1 [ASC | DESC];
```

* **ASC** = ascending (default)
* **DESC** = descending

---

## **2. Sorting by Multiple Columns**

When you list multiple columns, sorting happens **left to right**:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, age
FROM employees
ORDER BY last_name ASC, age DESC;
```

* Sorts by `last_name` first
* For rows with the same `last_name`, sorts by `age` descending

---

## **3. Using Column Positions**

You can sort by the **ordinal position** of the column in the `SELECT` list:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, age
FROM employees
ORDER BY 2, 3 DESC;  -- Sort by last_name, then age descending
```

⚠ **Warning:** This is less readable and prone to errors if column order changes.

---

## **4. Sorting by Expressions**

You can sort by computed values, not just columns:

```sql
SELECT product_name, price, quantity, price * quantity AS total_value
FROM products
ORDER BY total_value DESC;
```

You can also put the expression **directly**:

```sql
ORDER BY price * quantity DESC;
```

---

## **5. NULL Handling**

SQL standards differ in how NULLs are ordered:

* **PostgreSQL**: `NULLS FIRST` / `NULLS LAST` is explicit
* **MySQL**: NULLs come first in ASC, last in DESC (cannot change directly without tricks)
* **SQL Server**: Similar to MySQL, use `CASE` for control

**PostgreSQL Example:**

```sql
SELECT name, score
FROM players
ORDER BY score DESC NULLS LAST;
```

**MySQL Trick:**

```sql
ORDER BY score IS NULL, score DESC;
```

Yes — in **MySQL** (and MariaDB),

```sql
ORDER BY score IS NULL, score DESC;
```

**will put NULLs first** because of how `score IS NULL` evaluates:

* `score IS NULL` returns:

  * `1` (true) for NULL values
  * `0` (false) for non-NULL values
* By default, `ORDER BY` sorts **ascending**, so `0` (non-null) comes before `1` (null) — *unless you reverse it*.

So, with the query **as written**:

1. First sorts by `score IS NULL` ascending → **non-NULL first, NULL last**
2. Then sorts by `score DESC` within each group

---

If you want **NULLs first**, you flip it:

```sql
ORDER BY score IS NULL DESC, score DESC;
```

Now:

* `IS NULL` = 1 for NULLs → sorted before 0 (non-NULL)
* Then within each group, sorts by `score` descending

---

If you want, I can make you a **truth table** showing exactly how each combination of ASC/DESC + `IS NULL` affects ordering in MySQL.

---
---

## **6. Collation & Case Sensitivity**

`ORDER BY` respects the **collation** of the column, affecting:

* Case sensitivity (`A` vs `a`)
* Accent sensitivity (`é` vs `e`)

Example (PostgreSQL):

```sql
SELECT name FROM users
ORDER BY name COLLATE "en_US" ASC;
```
Right — the syntax you wrote:

```sql
ORDER BY name COLLATE "en_US" ASC;
```

is **PostgreSQL-style** (double quotes, LCID-style name).
MySQL and SQL Server both support `COLLATE`, but with different syntax and available collation names.

---

## **MySQL**

* Uses **collation names** like `utf8mb4_general_ci`, `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci`, etc.
* Syntax:

```sql
SELECT name
FROM users
ORDER BY name COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci ASC;
```

**Notes:**

* `ci` = case-insensitive, `cs` = case-sensitive, `ai` = accent-insensitive
* You can check collations with:

```sql
SHOW COLLATION;
```

---

## **SQL Server**

* Uses Windows collation names like `SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS` or `Latin1_General_CI_AI`.
* Syntax:

```sql
SELECT name
FROM users
ORDER BY name COLLATE Latin1_General_CI_AS ASC;
```

**Notes:**

* `CI` = case-insensitive, `CS` = case-sensitive
* `AI` = accent-insensitive, `AS` = accent-sensitive
* To list collations:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sys.fn_helpcollations();
```

---

✅ **Key difference:**

* PostgreSQL: `"en_US"` or `"C"` style locale names
* MySQL: `utf8mb4_*` style
* SQL Server: `Latin1_General_*` style

If you want, I can give you **parallel examples** for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server that all sort case-insensitively with accent-insensitive rules so you can see the exact mapping.

---

Got it — you’re asking where to **see the list of available collations/locales** like `"en_US"` in PostgreSQL (and equivalents in MySQL / SQL Server).

Here’s the breakdown by DBMS:

---

## **PostgreSQL**

PostgreSQL uses the **underlying OS locales** (from `libc`), so `"en_US"` is an example of a locale string.
You can list them with:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_collation;
```

or from the shell:

```bash
locale -a
```

Typical examples:

```
C
POSIX
en_US.utf8
en_GB.utf8
fr_FR.utf8
```

---

## **MySQL**

MySQL has **its own built-in list** of collations, each tied to a character set.
See them with:

```sql
SHOW COLLATION;
```

You’ll get output like:

```
utf8mb4_general_ci
utf8mb4_unicode_ci
utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
latin1_swedish_ci
```

The `_ci` suffix means **case-insensitive**, `_cs` means case-sensitive, `_ai` = accent-insensitive.

---

## **SQL Server**

SQL Server collations are fixed names like `Latin1_General_CI_AS`.
List them with:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sys.fn_helpcollations();
```

You’ll see:

```
SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS
Latin1_General_CI_AI
Latin1_General_BIN
```

---

💡 **Important:**

* PostgreSQL: locale names like `"en_US"` come from **your operating system**. If your OS doesn’t have a locale installed, PostgreSQL won’t list it.
* MySQL / SQL Server: collations are **baked into the database engine** — you don’t install them from the OS.

---

If you want, I can prepare a **cross-database table** showing `en_US` in PostgreSQL and its *closest match* in MySQL and SQL Server.

---

Alright — let’s go over the **default collation / locale** for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server, and how they’re determined.

---

## **1. PostgreSQL**

* **Default locale & collation:**
  Whatever was set during `initdb` when the cluster was created.
* Defaults typically:

  * On Linux: `en_US.UTF-8` (if OS locale is English US)
  * On some systems: `C` (binary sort order)
* Check current defaults:

```sql
SHOW lc_collate;   -- collation
SHOW lc_ctype;     -- character classification
```

**Note:** It inherits from the OS; change requires rebuilding the cluster.

---

## **2. MySQL**

* **Default collation:** Depends on **default character set** for the server.
* Since MySQL 8.0:

  * Default charset: `utf8mb4`
  * Default collation: `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci` (accent-insensitive, case-insensitive)
* Before MySQL 8.0:

  * Default charset: `latin1`
  * Default collation: `latin1_swedish_ci` (a historic oddity)
* Check defaults:

```sql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'collation_server';
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'character_set_server';
```

---

## **3. SQL Server**

* **Default collation:** Set during SQL Server installation; no universal fixed default.
* If you don’t change it during install, on English Windows it’s usually:

  * `SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS` (case-insensitive, accent-sensitive)
* Check:

```sql
SELECT SERVERPROPERTY('Collation');
```

**Note:** Each database can have its own collation, and each column can override that.

---

📌 **Summary Table**

| DBMS       | Default Collation (modern installs) | Case | Accent | Source         |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ---- | ------ | -------------- |
| PostgreSQL | `en_US.UTF-8` *(varies by OS)*      | OS   | OS     | OS locale      |
| MySQL 8.0+ | `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci`                | CI   | AI     | Built-in       |
| MySQL <8.0 | `latin1_swedish_ci`                 | CI   | AI     | Built-in       |
| SQL Server | `SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS`      | CI   | AS     | Install option |

---

If you want, I can also show you **how to create a database in all three systems using `en_US`-style sorting** so you explicitly avoid surprises with mixed language data.

---

Yep — **binary sort** is when the database orders text purely by the **numeric code point values** of the characters, without applying locale-specific rules.

---

## **1. What It Means**

* In binary sort, `"A"` (ASCII 65) comes before `"a"` (ASCII 97) because 65 < 97 — no “case-insensitive” magic.
* No accent folding — `"é"` comes after `"z"` because its byte/code point value is higher.
* Fast — no locale comparison overhead.

---

## **2. In Each DBMS**

### **PostgreSQL**

* Locale `C` or `POSIX` uses binary ordering.
* Example:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE testdb LC_COLLATE 'C' LC_CTYPE 'C' TEMPLATE template0;
```

* Ordering:

```
A
B
Z
a
b
z
é
```

---

### **MySQL**

* Collations ending with `_bin` are binary.
* Example:

```sql
SELECT name FROM users ORDER BY name COLLATE utf8mb4_bin;
```

* Here `"A"` < `"a"` < `"é"` strictly by Unicode code points.

---

### **SQL Server**

* Collations ending with `_BIN` or `_BIN2` are binary.
* `_BIN2` uses modern code point order, `_BIN` uses older sort order.
* Example:

```sql
SELECT name FROM users ORDER BY name COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2;
```

---

## **3. Pros & Cons**

✅ **Pros:**

* Fastest sorting method
* Predictable for pure ASCII data
* Useful for case-sensitive searches

❌ **Cons:**

* Unnatural for users — `"Z"` before `"a"`
* Doesn’t group accented characters with their base form
* Locale-insensitive — bad for multilingual data

---

💡 Tip: If you’re doing **case-sensitive usernames or passwords** in MySQL, you often see `_bin` collations. But for *display sorting*, users usually prefer locale-aware collations like `en_US.UTF-8` or `utf8mb4_unicode_ci`.

---

If you want, I can make you a **side-by-side example** showing the sort order of 20 sample strings under **binary**, **case-insensitive**, and **accent-insensitive** rules.

## **7. ORDER BY in Subqueries**

You *cannot* always use `ORDER BY` in subqueries unless:

* It’s in a subquery with `TOP`, `LIMIT`, or `FETCH FIRST`
* Or it’s the outermost query

Example:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM (SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY price DESC LIMIT 5) AS top_products
ORDER BY name;
```

---

## **8. Performance Considerations**

* Sorting is **costly** on large datasets; use proper indexes.
* **Index helps** only if `ORDER BY` matches the index order and filter.
* Mixed ASC/DESC in one query may prevent index usage.
* Use **`EXPLAIN`** to see sort execution plans.

---

## **9. ORDER BY with LIMIT / OFFSET**

Common for pagination:

```sql
SELECT id, name
FROM products
ORDER BY name ASC
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;
```

⚠ Beware: Without a unique `ORDER BY`, pagination may return duplicate/missing rows across pages.

Better:

```sql
ORDER BY name ASC, id ASC
```
Alright — let’s compare **OFFSET pagination** vs **keyset pagination** so you can see exactly why big OFFSET values are slow.

---

## **1. OFFSET Pagination**

```sql
SELECT id, name
FROM products
ORDER BY name ASC
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 1000000;
```

**What happens internally**:

1. DB **sorts** all rows by `name`.
2. DB **reads and discards** the first 1,000,000 rows.
3. DB **returns** the next 10 rows.

🔴 **Bad for large OFFSET**:

* Sorting is expensive (needs memory/disk if big).
* Discarding millions of rows wastes CPU & I/O.
* Query time grows linearly with OFFSET.

---

## **2. Keyset Pagination (Seek Method)**

```sql
SELECT id, name
FROM products
WHERE name > 'Zebra-1000000'  -- last name from previous page
ORDER BY name ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

**What happens internally**:

1. DB **uses index** on `name` to jump directly to `'Zebra-1000000'`.
2. DB **fetches** the next 10 rows — no big skip.

🟢 **Fast** even for page 1,000,000:

* No wasted row scanning.
* Can leverage B-tree index efficiently.
* Query time stays constant regardless of “page number”.

---

## **3. When to use which**

* **OFFSET** is fine for small page numbers (page 1–20).
* **Keyset** is the only practical way for deep pagination in big datasets.
* **Hybrid approach**: Use OFFSET for small ranges + keyset for deep jumps.

---

💡 **Extra tip for stable paging**
Always include a **tie-breaker column** in `ORDER BY` for deterministic results:

```sql
ORDER BY name ASC, id ASC
```

This avoids duplicates/missing rows if `name` values are the same.

---

If you want, I can make you a **visual diagram** showing exactly how MySQL/PostgreSQL walks through the index in both cases — it’s very eye-opening why OFFSET burns CPU.

---

A **tie-breaker** in `ORDER BY` is an **extra column (or columns)** you add to make sorting **fully deterministic** when the main sort column has duplicate values.

---

## **Why it matters**

If you only do:

```sql
ORDER BY name ASC
```

and multiple rows have the same `name`,
the database is free to return them **in any order** among themselves — and that order may **change** between queries (especially if the table is updated or parallel execution changes row order).

This is **a problem for pagination** because:

* A row might appear on page 2 in one query and page 1 in the next.
* Or the same row might appear twice across different pages.

---

## **The Tie-breaker Fix**

```sql
ORDER BY name ASC, id ASC
```

Here:

1. Sort by `name` first.
2. If `name` is the same for two rows, sort by `id`.

This guarantees:

* **Stable order** for all rows.
* Pagination won’t skip or repeat rows.

---

### Example

Data:

| id | name  |
| -- | ----- |
| 1  | Alice |
| 2  | Bob   |
| 3  | Alice |
| 4  | Bob   |

`ORDER BY name ASC` → might give:

```
Alice (id 1)
Alice (id 3)
Bob (id 2)
Bob (id 4)
```

…or:

```
Alice (id 3)
Alice (id 1)
Bob (id 4)
Bob (id 2)
```

`ORDER BY name ASC, id ASC` → always:

```
Alice (id 1)
Alice (id 3)
Bob (id 2)
Bob (id 4)
```

---

In **keyset pagination**, the tie-breaker column is also used in the `WHERE` clause:

```sql
WHERE (name > 'Alice')
   OR (name = 'Alice' AND id > 1)
ORDER BY name ASC, id ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

This ensures the query always picks the “next” rows reliably.

---

If you want, I can show you **what can go wrong** with OFFSET pagination **without** a tie-breaker — including duplicated or missing rows between pages.

## **10. Random Order**

For fun or sampling:

* PostgreSQL:

```sql
ORDER BY RANDOM();
```

* MySQL:

```sql
ORDER BY RAND();
```

* SQL Server:

```sql
ORDER BY NEWID();
```

⚠ Very slow for big tables.

---

## **11. ORDER BY with CASE (Custom Sort)**

You can define your own order:

```sql
SELECT name, status
FROM orders
ORDER BY CASE status
    WHEN 'urgent' THEN 1
    WHEN 'high'   THEN 2
    WHEN 'normal' THEN 3
    ELSE 4
END;
```
Here are the **shorter alternatives** to your `CASE`-based custom sort — one for **MySQL** and one for **PostgreSQL**.

---

## **1. MySQL: `FIELD()` function**

```sql
SELECT name, status
FROM orders
ORDER BY FIELD(status, 'urgent', 'high', 'normal') ASC;
```

* `FIELD()` returns the **position** of the value in the list:

  * `urgent` → 1
  * `high`   → 2
  * `normal` → 3
  * anything else → 0 (comes first unless you handle it)

To make unknown statuses go **last**:

```sql
ORDER BY FIELD(status, 'urgent', 'high', 'normal') = 0, 
         FIELD(status, 'urgent', 'high', 'normal');
```

---

## **2. PostgreSQL: `ARRAY_POSITION()`**

```sql
SELECT name, status
FROM orders
ORDER BY ARRAY_POSITION(ARRAY['urgent','high','normal'], status);
```

* Works similarly — returns index of the match in the array.
* Unknown values return `NULL`, which you can push last:

```sql
ORDER BY ARRAY_POSITION(ARRAY['urgent','high','normal'], status) NULLS LAST;
```

---

💡 **When to use `CASE` vs `FIELD()`/`ARRAY_POSITION()`**

* Use **`CASE`** if you want **maximum compatibility** across all SQL dialects.
* Use **`FIELD()`** or **`ARRAY_POSITION()`** if you’re in MySQL/PostgreSQL and want **shorter, cleaner syntax**.

---

If you want, I can also give you the **SQL Server** version using `CHARINDEX()` or `CASE` so you have a complete cross-DB reference.
